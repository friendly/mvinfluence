# mvinfluence
**Influence Measures and Diagnostic Plots for Multivariate Linear Models**

Functions in this package compute regression deletion diagnostics for multivariate linear models and provides some associated
diagnostic plots.  The diagnostic measures include hat-values (leverages), generalized Cook's distance, and
generalized squared 'studentized' residuals.  Several types of plots to detect influential observations are
provided.
