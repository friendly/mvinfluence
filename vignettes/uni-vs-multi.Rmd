Influence measures are well-known for linear models with a single response variable.
These measures, such as Cook's D, DFFITS and DFBETAS assess the impact of each observation by calculating measures of
the change in regression coefficients, fitted values, etc. when that observation is omitted from
the data (Belsley, Kuh and Welsch (1980), Cook and Weisberg (1982)).

For models with two or more response variables, the functions in the `mvinfluence` package
calculate natural extensions of the standard measures `hatvalues`, `cooks.distance`
according to the theory presented in Barrett & Ling (1992). However, multivariate influence
turns out to be more interesting and complex than just the collection of diagnostics for
the separate responses, as this example illustrates.

## A Toy Example

This example, from Barrett (2003), considers the simplest case, of one predictor (`x`) and
two response variables, `y1` and `y2`.

```{r toy-data}
Toy <- tibble(
   case = 1:9,
   x =  c(1,    1,    2,    2,    3,    3,    4,    4,    10),
   y1 = c(0.10, 1.90, 1.00, 2.95, 2.10, 4.00, 2.95, 4.95, 10.00),
   y2 = c(0.10, 1.80, 1.00, 2.93, 2.00, 4.10, 3.05, 4.93, 10.00)
)
```

A quick peek at the data indicates that `y1` and `y2` are nearly perfectly correlated.
Both of these are linear with `x` and there is one extreme point (case 9). Looking at these
pairwise plots doesn't suggest that anything is terribly wrong.

```{r scatmat}
car::scatterplotMatrix(~y1 + y2 + x, data=Toy, cex=2,
        col = "blue", pch = 16,
        id = list(n=1, cex=2), 
        regLine = list(lwd = 2, col="red"),
        smooth = FALSE)
```

We can view the data in 3D, using `car::scatter3d()`. The regression plane shown is that for the model `y1 ~ y2 + x`.
The plot is interactive: you can rotate and zoom using the mouse to see the views shown in the scatterplots.
If you rotate the plot so the regression plane becomes a line, you can see that the data ellipsoid is essentially flat.

```{r}
car::scatter3d(y1 ~ y2 + x, data=Toy,
               ellipsoid = TRUE,              # show the data ellipsoid
               radius = c(rep(1,8), 2),       # make case 9 larger
               grid.col = "pink", grid.lines = 10, 
               fill = FALSE,
               id = list(n=1), offset=2
               )
rgl::rglwidget()
```

## Models
We fit the univariate models with `y1` and `y2` separately and then the multivariate model.

```{r models}
Toy.lm1 <- lm(y1 ~ x, data=Toy)
Toy.lm2 <- lm(y2 ~ x, data=Toy)
Toy.mlm <- lm(cbind(y1, y2) ~ x, data=Toy)
```

### Cook's D

First, let's examine the Cook's D statistics for the models. Note that the function `cooks.distance()`
invokes `stats::cooks.distance.lm()` for the univariate response models, but
invokes `mvinfluence::cooks.distance.mlm()` for the multivariate model.

The only thing remarkable here is for case 9:  The univariate Cook's Ds, `D1` and `D2` are very small,
yet the multivariate statistic, `D12` is over 10 times the next smallest value.
```{r cooks-distance}
df <- Toy
df$D1  <- cooks.distance(Toy.lm1)
df$D2  <- cooks.distance(Toy.lm2)
df$D12 <- cooks.distance(Toy.mlm)

df
```

We can see how case 9 stands out in the influence plots. It has an extreme hat value, but, because it's residual is
very small, it does not have much influence on the fitted models for either `y1` or `y2`. Neither of these plots
suggest that anything is terribly wrong with the univariate models.
```{r inflplots, fig.show='hold', out.width="45%", out.height="50%", collapse=FALSE}
ip1 <- car::influencePlot(Toy.lm1, id=list(cex=1.5))
ip2 <- car::influencePlot(Toy.lm2, id=list(cex=1.5))
```

Contrast these results with what we get for the model for `y1` and `y2` jointly. 
In the multivariate version, `influencePlot.mlm` plots the squared studentized residual (denoted `Q` in the output)
against the hat value.  Case 9 stands out as wildly influential.

```{r inflplot-mlm, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
influencePlot(Toy.mlm, id.n=2)
```

An alternative form of the multivariate influence plot uses the leverage (`L`) and residual (`R`) components. 
Because influence is the product of leverage and residual, a plot of $\log(L)$ versus $\log(R)$ has the attractive property
that contours of constant Cook's distance fall on diagonal lines with slope = -1. 
Adjacent reference lines represent constant _multiples_ of influence.

```{r inflplot-mlm-lr, fig.width=5, fig.height=4, fig.align='center', results='hide'}
par(mar = c(4,4,1,1)+.1)
influencePlot(Toy.mlm, id.n=2, type = 'LR')
```

### DFBETAS

The DFBETAS statistics give the estimated change in the regression coefficients when each case is deleted in turn.
We can gain some insight as to why case 9 is unremarkable in the univariate regressions by plotting these.
The values come from `stats::dfbetas` and return the standardized values.

```{r dfbetas-plot, fig.width=9, fig.height=4.5}
db1 <- as.data.frame(dfbetas(Toy.lm1))
gg1 <- ggplot(data = db1, aes(x=`(Intercept)`, y=x, label=rownames(db1))) +
  geom_point(size=1.5) +
  geom_label(size=6, fill="pink") +
  xlab(expression(paste("Deletion Intercept  ", b[0]))) +
  ylab(expression(paste("Deletion Slope  ", b[1]))) +
  ggtitle("dfbetas for y1") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)

db2 <- as.data.frame(dfbetas(Toy.lm2))
gg2 <- ggplot(data = db2, aes(x=`(Intercept)`, y=x, label=rownames(db2))) +
  geom_point(size=1.5) +
  geom_label(size=6, fill="pink") +
  xlab(expression(paste("Deletion Intercept  ", b[0]))) +
  ylab(expression(paste("Deletion Slope  ", b[1]))) +
  ggtitle("dfbetas for y2") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)

gg1 + gg2
```

The values for case 9 are nearly (0, 0) in both plots, indicating that deleting this case has negligible effect
in both univariate regressions.
