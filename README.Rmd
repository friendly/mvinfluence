**Influence Measures and Diagnostic Plots for Multivariate Linear Models**

Functions in this package compute regression deletion diagnostics for multivariate linear models following
methods proposed by  Barrett & Ling (1992)
and provide some associated
diagnostic plots.  The diagnostic measures include hat-values (leverages), generalized Cook's distance, and
generalized squared 'studentized' residuals.  Several types of plots to detect influential observations are
provided.

In addition, the functions provide diagnostics for deletion of
subsets of observations of size `m>1`. This case is theoretically interesting
because sometimes pairs (`m=2`) of influential observations can mask each other,
sometimes they can have joint influence far exceeding their individual effects,
as well as other interesting phenomena described by Lawrence (1995).
Associated methods for the case
`m>1` are still under development in this package.

## Installation

Get the released version from CRAN:

     install.packages("mvinfluence")

## Goals

The design goal for this package is that, as an extension of standard methods for univariate linear models, you should
be able to fit a linear model with a **multivariate** response,

    mymlm <- lm( cbind(y1, y2, y3) ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data=mydata)

and then get useful diagnostics and plots with:

    influence(mymlm)
    hatvalues(mymlm)
    cooks.distance(mymlm)
    influencePlot(mymlm, ...)  

As is done in comparable univariate functions in the `car` package, _noteworthy_ points are
identified in printed output and graphs.

## Examples

Here, we fit a MLM to a subset of the Rohwer data (the Low SES group).
The default influence plot (`type="stres"`) shows the squared standardized residual against the Hat value.
The areas of the circles representing the observations are proportional to generalized Cook's distances. 
```{r rohwer1}
data(Rohwer, package="heplots")
Rohwer2 <- subset(Rohwer, subset=group==2)
rownames(Rohwer2)<- 1:nrow(Rohwer2)
Rohwer.mod <- lm(cbind(SAT, PPVT, Raven) ~ n+s+ns+na+ss, data=Rohwer2)

(infl <-influencePlot(Rohwer.mod, id.n=4, type = "stres"))
```

The function returns (and prints) a data frame  of the influence statistics for the identified points.
"Noteworthy" points are those that are unusual on _either_ Hat value (H) or the squared studentized residual (Q),
so more points will be shown than the `id.n` value.
It is often more useful to sort these in descending order by one of the influence measures.

```{r infl}
infl |> dplyr::arrange(desc(H))
```


An alternative (`type="LR"`) plots residual components against leverage components,
both on log scales. Because influence is a product of residual * Leverage, this plot
had the property that contours of constant Cook's distance fall on diagonal
lines with slope = -1. This plot is often easier to read than the standard version.

```{r rohwer2}
influencePlot(Rohwer.mod, id.n=4, type="LR")
```

If you wish to see how the observations fare on each of the the measures (as well as Mahalanobis $D^2$),
the `inflIndexPlot()` function gives you index plots.

```{r indexplot, fig.width=9}
infIndexPlot(Rohwer.mod, id.n=3, id.col = "red", id.cex=1.5)
```

In this example, note that while case 5 stands out as influential, it does not have an exceptionally
large $D^2$.
